Our theme based Creative Cakes, Cake pop , Cup Cakes and Desserts for Parities, 
make you Party Unique and Inevitable. We spend more time in understanding customers expectation,

So we Perfectly Personalize to the Needs.At ‘The Bake Shop’ we follow a fairly simple philosophy
 – offer a product of outstanding quality and ensure customer loyalty. The simplicity of that principle is backed
  up by a lot of hard work and years of experience.When you send a cake, we know you aren’t just sending dessert.
   You are sending a moment of celebration, joy, healing and togetherness. When you can’t be there to celebrate in person,
    We Take The Cake makes it easy to delight your family, friends and colleagues with our freshly baked desserts delivered
     right to their doorstep ready to enjoy. Our experienced bakers mix all of our batters and frostings by hand,
      just like grandma used to make. We always bake with whole buttermilk, fresh eggs and real butter – never a
       cake mix or commercially made frostings.

  We understand that elegant presentation matters as much as the taste, and our team of very talented cake artisans take 
  the time to decorate every cake by hand. Our shipping team then carefully packages your cake in our custom designed
   decorative boxes and sends them off to you. We Take The Cake goes the extra mile to make sure our mail order desserts
    deliver an experience that makes you proud that you chose us to create the gift people will talk about long after the 
    celebration is over.
  
  The We Take The Cake team is a diverse group of people working closely together each day to provide desserts that
   help people celebrate the joys in their own lives and the lives of others. To share love and good wishes. And to bring
    a bit of comfort and happiness to those who deserve it. We love what we do, take pride in each and every cake we put our name on,
     and guarantee your complete satisfaction. We live our mission everyday – to help people celebrate, commemorate, appreciate,
      and send a message of love through the joy of cake. We look forward to playing a small part in the important times in your lives.</p>
